                Pagudpud is a 4th class municipality in Ilocos Norte, located at the northernmost tip of Luzon Island in the Philippines. It has a population of around 25,000 people as of the 2020 census. The town is bordered by the South China Sea to the north and west, Bangui to the south, and the Cordillera mountain range to the east. Its terrain is a mix of mountains, hills, valleys, and beautiful coastal plains, giving it a rich natural landscape. Pagudpud is well-known for its tropical climate and stunning beaches, such as Saud Beach and Maira-ira Cove, also known as the Blue Lagoon. These beaches attract many tourists because of their clear waters, white sand, and peaceful surroundings. Aside from beaches, Pagudpud also has famous natural attractions like Kabigan Falls, Bantay Abot Cave, and the scenic Patapat Viaduct, which offers a breathtaking view of the coastline. The town's economy mainly depends on tourism, fishing, and farming. In recent years, Pagudpud has also become part of Ilocos Norte's renewable energy projects, with wind farms located in nearby areas. The municipality was officially established on February 14, 1954, after being separated from the neighboring town of Bangui. Today, Pagudpud remains one of the most popular tourist destinations in Northern Luzon, known for its natural beauty and relaxing coastal charm.

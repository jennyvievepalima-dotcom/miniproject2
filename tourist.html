        <p class="des">Pagudpud is a coastal town located at the northernmost tip of Ilocos Norte. It is known as the “Boracay of the North”, but it has so much more to offer apart from its pristine coastline. Pagudpud's Bangui Bay also features 20 wind turbines, which makes it Southeast Asia's first windmill farm.</p>

                    <p class="des1">The bridge is elevated 31 meters (102 ft) over sea level. It is a concrete coastal bridge 1.3 kilometers (0.81 mi) long, 9.42 meters (30.9 ft) wide,[1] and connects the Maharlika Highway and the MacArthur Highway from the Ilocos Region to Cagayan Valley. The viaduct was constructed by Hanil Development Co. Ltd. under the overall management of DPWH-PMO-PJHK and was completed and opened to traffic in October 1986. It rises along the town's coastal mountains, which is the starting point of the Cordillera Mountain Range that snakes through Northern Luzon. It is the 4th longest bridge in the Philippines.</p>

                    <p class="des1">The Agua Grande River, also called Dakkel a Danum in Ilocano, is known for its eco-friendly and non-carbon-producing mini-hydroelectric power plant. Commissioned in 1983, it has been providing renewable energy to the towns of Pagudpud, Bangui, Dumalneg, Adams, and Burgos. The river, along with the Mabogabog Falls, supplies the water that powers the Agua Grande turbines. The Ilocos Norte Electric Cooperative also conducted a study on the hydro plant and another similar facility. Built during the Marcos administration, the plant has a power capacity of 4.5 megawatts, enough to provide electricity to around 17,000 households in Pagudpud and nearby areas such as Pasuquin and Bacarra.</p>

                    <p class="des1">Dos Hermanos Island is located in Barangay Balaoi and is known for its two identical, cone-shaped mountains. According to legend, the islands represent two brothers who were deeply devoted to each other. One day, while fishing, they were caught in a strong typhoon and drowned together. As a symbol of their loyalty, they were transformed into the twin mountains that now form Dos Hermanos Island. Beneath the rocks are caves filled with colorful tropical fish, best seen during low tide. The surrounding waters also contain smaller rocks where gamet, a famous edible seaweed, grows during the rainy season. The area lies north of Bangui and its well-known windmills, with the Cordillera Mountain Range standing inland and the South China Sea stretching to the north and west.</p>

                    <p class="des1">The Caunayan Landing Site in Sitio Liwliwa at Bimmanaaw holds great historical importance in both Philippine and World War II history.

Also known as the Stingray Memorial, it was built to honor the bravery of Filipino bolomen, guerrillas, and the crews of 20 American submarines that supplied them with weapons and materials. Sponsored by the Philippine Veterans Bank, the memorial is made of marble, stone, and pebbles, and is topped with a 500-kilogram anchor. The Caunayan Landing Site stands as a lasting reminder of courage, sacrifice, and unity during a crucial time in history.</p>
